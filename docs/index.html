    <h3>What is BArK?</h3>
    BArK is a multi-function tool for editing bitsy game data. The intention is to keep the data compatible with the original bitsy editor. 
    Unlike Borksy, these are not post-editing hacks.<br/><br/>
    The tools in BArK are either for making changes which bitsy supports, but which the editor does not, or to make complex tedious changes which
    would otherwise be time-consuming or difficult in the bitsy editor.
    <h3>How do I use BArK?</h3>
    There are 4 windows in BArK.
    <ul>
      <li>The Explorer. Top left, this is a tree of the elements that BArK is managing. Your games will appear in the <em>Games</em> branch</li>
      <li>The Toolbox. Below the Explorer, this list all of the tools available for the item selected in the Explorer</li>
      <li>The Viewer. At the top right, this displays information about the item currently selected in the Explorer</li>
      <li>The Tool. Below the Viewer, if you have selected a tool in the Toolbox, this is where the controls for that tool will appear</li>
    </ul>
    To start, select the <em>Import Game</em> tool from the <em>Games</em> branch of the tree. And then paste or drag your game data to the tool.
    To save your edits, select your game from within the <em>Games</em> branch of the tree, and then select the <em>Game Data</em> tool.
